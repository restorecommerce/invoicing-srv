A microservice for generating invoices.

[#features]
== Features

* Generates invoices for customers based on their purchased products.
* When all data is aggregated, it is rendered into HTML through the
https://github.com/restorecommerce/rendering-srv[rendering-srv] and to PDF using the
https://github.com/restorecommerce/pdf-rendering-srv[pdf-rendering-srv].
* The header and footer templates for PDF rendering are served via HTML files.
* All invoices are sent via notification objects to the
https://github.com/restorecommerce/notification-srv[notification-srv]
so that they can be sent via email to the customers' billing addresses.

* The Invoice Positions sent to this service are stored on redis (db index 7)
and Invoice creation is triggered by `io.restorecommerce.invoice.TriggerInvoices`
event named `triggerInvoices` which sends out the notifications to customers.
Invoices are also a resource owned by this microservice. After an invoice is generated,
it is stored in the database along with useful metadata. Therefore, some CRUD operations
are exposed via gRPC in order to remotely handle this resource.

[#custom_commands]
=== Custom Commands

This service extends the
https://github.com/restorecommerce/chassis-srv/blob/master/command-interface.md[command-interface]
in order to provide custom functionality:

- `restore` - the base restore operation is extended to additionally restore the invoice number's incremental counter in Redis
- `reset` - the base reset operation is overridden in order to reset the invoice's number incremental counter in Redis

[#todo]
== TODO: Resource Caching with Redis
* Resources are loaded via gRPC calls.
Currently, they are stored in local variables which are then statically accessed.
An efficient caching mechanism using Redis with some expiration time is to be used.
